The physical and societal aspects of the Curies' work contributed to shaping the
world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.[78]  Cornell University professor L. Pearce Williams observes:

<blockquote> 
The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so
great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the
conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations
of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like
Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the
structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha
radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity
of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully
attacked.[37]

If Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it
has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her
scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and
her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. This
aspect of her life and career is highlighted in Fran√ßoise Giroud's Marie Curie:
A Life, which emphasizes Curie's role as a feminist precursor.[14]

She was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle.[22][78] Having received a
small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning
her keep.[11][30] She gave much of her first Nobel Prize money to friends,
family, students, and research associates.[14] In an unusual decision, Curie
intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the
scientific community could do research unhindered.[79] She insisted that
monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was
affiliated with rather than to her.[78] She and her husband often refused awards
and medals.[22] Albert Einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the
only person who could not be corrupted by fame.[14]
